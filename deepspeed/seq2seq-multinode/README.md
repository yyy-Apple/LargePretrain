# Multi-node Training for seq2seq
This is the folder that documents how to perform multi-node training on a [Slurm cluster](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html). Required packages are in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh). We will run a seq2seq example using `t5-11b` as an example. 

More details about multi-mode training can refer to [`classification-multinode`](../classification-multinode) folder.
